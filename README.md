# quiz_app_enhancement

This project is a result of the udemy tutorial quiz_app. 

## Additional Features
Aside from the feautures presented in the udemy tutorals, our project has one additional feature where can restart the quiz when its finished. When you are done with the quiz, an "resart quiz" button appears and when pressed, it takes you back to the start screen, with all previous questions erased (you can start fresh).

## App Architecture
The project follows the same architecture as is presented when creating a new project. We added a "data" folder and a "models", which respectyly holds the data files (questions) and the model files.

## User Stories
In this project we didnt use user stories because the majority of the the app was presented by the udemy course. As for our additional feature, we simply thought that a restart button as needed.
